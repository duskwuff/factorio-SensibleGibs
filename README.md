Sensible Gibs
=============

Sensible Gibs (as opposed to Ludicrous Gibs) reduces the intensity of
graphical effects emitted by dying enemies, which may improve FPS during
intense combat.

There are three levels which can be configured in the mod settings:

* "Light" dramatically reduces the lifetime of blood and gore particles
  emitted when enemies die. This reduces the number of draw calls needed
  when many enemies are being killed in a short time.

* "Heavy" also removes the blood pools displayed under biter and spitter corpses.

* "Extreme" makes biter and spitter corpses fade out after 30 seconds. (The
  default is 15 minutes!) This changes the feel of the game substantially, but
  may be helpful if you're killing a ton of enemies.
